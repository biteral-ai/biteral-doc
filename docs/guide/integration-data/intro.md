# Integrate data

Biteral analyzes your product data and customer behavior to provide tools such as personalized recommendations, natural language search, trend analysis, or customer tags. Therefore, sending accurate and up-to-date data to Biteral is key to getting the most out of the platform.

Although you can send us the data in an Excel or CSV file, it is highly recommended to do so through the API or the PHP SDK. This guarantees maximum flexibility and allows Biteral to work in real time, always adapting to the latest data.

:::tip
In many cases, this immediacy is key: for example, Biteral can suggest the most suitable products right after a purchase, taking advantage of the moment of highest customer interest.

These are the three key types of data you need to send to Biteral:

| <Badge icon="product" text="Products" transparent />| <Badge icon="customer" text="Customers" transparent /> | <Badge icon="event" text="Events" transparent /> |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The items you offer: name, description, price, features, etc.| Internal identifiers for tracking: location, customer type, etc. | Actions they perform: visits, purchases, add to cart, etc. |
