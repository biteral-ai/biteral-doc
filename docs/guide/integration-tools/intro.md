# Integrate tools

Biteral's tools such as [natural search](https://biteral.ai/natural-search), [personalized recommendations](https://biteral.ai/personalized-recommend), [trend analysis](https://biteral.ai/trend-analysis) or [customer tags](http://biteral.ai/profile-tags) can be manually integrated into your system using the API or the SDK, allowing you to create custom integrations according to your needs.
