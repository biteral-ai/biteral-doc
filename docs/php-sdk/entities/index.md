# Entities

Entities represent, for example, the customers or products of your e-commerce within Biteral. They not only contain the original data you provided but also additional information generated by Biteral, like the entity's internal identifier or the date it was added.

For example, when you get a product with <Badge variant="sdk php method" text="$client->products()->get()" />, you get as a result an object (entity) of the <Badge variant="sdk php entity" text="Product" to="/php-sdk/entities/product" /> class containing, among other things, the internal product identifier in Biteral, the date it was added, and the date it was last modified.

:::info
Additionally, it also includes the original <Badge variant="sdk php payload" text="ProductPayload" to="/php-sdk/payloads/product-payload" /> of the object, available at `$result->payload`
:::

### Example

```php
// Get a product
$result = $client->products()->getByCode('N39291');

// Shows the product's id in Biteral
echo $result->id; // "pro_jK2j391Xxmd34K"

// Shows the product's title
echo $result->payload->title; // "Urban sports shoes for men – AirFlow model"
```
